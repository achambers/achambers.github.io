        <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/rvm">RVM</a> <span class="date">2011-05-24</span></h3>

        <p>I had a &#39;light bulb&#39; moment the other day when I actually understood the value of <a href="http://rvm.io" title="RVM">RVM</a>. Before then I was using it, but didn&#39;t really understand why and what value it was giving me. The reason for this was because I didn&#39;t really understand what it does and what it&#39;s trying to solve. I am no expert in RVM by any means but this is my understanding of RVM and why and how I use it.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">What is RVM?</h3>

<p>RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager. It basically allows you to manage multiple versions of Ruby on your system and more importantly, I think, it allows you to sandbox Ruby versions and gem sets so that each project can have it&#39;s own encapsulated environment with only the gems that are required. This will ultimately save you from dealing with sneaky versioning issues between gems and also allows you run apps against new version of Ruby and gems without upgrading your system version.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">How RVM works</h3>

<p>When you install Ruby to your system normally it is installed to a system directory like /user/bin/ruby for instance (on Mac OS X). When you install gems using the system version of Ruby/Rubygems they are all installed into the same system directory. This means that different versions of the same gem are installed into the same place and it also means that gems from across all projects that use that version of Ruby are installed into the same place. This can cause multiple hassles from gem version collisions to inconsistent environment set ups between development and staging/production.</p>

<p>RVM however, allows you to run multiple versions of Ruby with multiple gem sets all sandboxed in their own environment specific directory within RVM. For starters, RVM installs itself in the <code>~/.rvm</code> directory. This means that you no longer need to use <code>sudo</code> to install gems. This also means that from now on, any Ruby versions or gems you install are installed into the RVM directory and kept completely separate from your system installation of Ruby.</p>

<p>When you use RVM to switch to a particular version of Ruby and/or a particular gemset it essentially switches the PATH variables that point to the Ruby version and gems directory. From that point onwards, you use Ruby exactly as you normally would. It&#39;s a pretty simple concept when you think about it. But it is oh so powerful.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">How to install a Ruby version</h3>

<p>Once you have RVM installed (follow the instructions to do this on the website above), the first thing you will want to do is install a version of Ruby. First lets see which version of Ruby are available to us:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm list known
</code></pre>

<p>In this instance we&#39;ll install version 1.9.2-head by typing the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm install ruby-1.9.2-head
</code></pre>

<p>RVM has now installed our required version of Ruby and set it to be the current one. We can check this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm current
#=&gt; ruby-1.9.2-head
</code></pre>

<p>We can also see which other version of Ruby we have installed in RVM:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm list
#=&gt; ruby-1.9.2-p180 [ x86_64 ] 
#=&gt; ruby-1.9.2-head [ x86_64 ]
</code></pre>

        <p>It has to be said, I am the type of person that gets very focussed on a particular subject. When in this focussed mode, I find it very difficult to look outside of my field of vision at other options as I&#39;m so focussed on achieving what is currently set out in front of me. Every now and then though, something will connect with me in the right way, at the right moment, that will allow me to open my eyes a little to a new idea or concept and it will change my thoughts and perception instantly.</p>

<p>This has been my history with many things including music, gadgets I want to buy, shows I like to watch, and programming languages.</p>

<p>The reason I bring this up is because up until a while ago Ruby was one of those things that I just didn&#39;t have an interest in looking at because I was too focussed on Java. I have been using Java for over 10 years and I am good at it. And I am focussed on continually getting better at it. That was until about 6 months ago when I was working in a team that used Ruby for testing their Java apps. It was at this point that the wonder of Ruby hit me from out of nowhere. I was temporarily distracted from Java and Ruby came in and blew me away. And now I can&#39;t stop thinking about it, to the extent that I don&#39;t want to waste any more time on Java. How the hell did this happen?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you how. </p>

<p>Over the space of a few weeks I was explained what Ruby is and how it works. I was shown the sexy and efficient syntax and how much more time efficient some of the constructs that are built into the language are than Java. I was shown how easy it is to get a basic RESTful &#39;Hello World&#39; app up and running, measured literally in seconds as opposed to minutes or hours in Java. I was shown the wonder of BDD with cucumber and how executable instructions written in plain english can make functional testing and bridging the gap between developers and product ownsers a pleasure. And, one of the most important things, I learnt and understood aspects about the under the covers of Ruby that I never knew, learnt or cared to learn about Java. And it all made sense. </p>

<p>All these things got me intrigued enough to wonder whether I should be looking harder into Ruby and whether Java really was the language I wanted to focus the majority of my time on. The feeling I was starting to get from those 6 months with Ruby was why am I using Java?  Ruby makes things so much easier, simpler and most importantly quicker. It is a pleasure to use Ruby. I was getting a feeling that I had not really ever experienced from Java. This made me want to learn more.</p>

<p>So, that is my quest at the moment. Ruby has stolen my focus for now. I am on a crusade to become great at it. I am not giving up on Java by any means, I am mearly expanding my toolkit. But I think, for now, I&#39;m aiming on moving my Java hammer to the side and hanging the shiny new Ruby one in the center of the tool shed. </p>

<p>Side Note: It&#39;s funny because over the years I have heard countless stories of developers working in a Java role who would always bang on about Ruby and bust it out to automate different small tasks. I never understood why. Now I do. And I think I&#39;m turning into one of them :)</p>

        <p>So, that little project that <a href="http://liquidarmour.biz/" title="Liquid Armour">Liquid Armour</a> and I have been working on has finally started to see the light of day. The site is called CoffeeSnobs and can be found at <a href="http://coffeesnobs.in/london" title="CoffeeSnobs">http://coffeesnobs.in/london</a> . It is a work in progress and we&#39;ll be constantly improving the site as we go.</p>

<p>CoffeeSnobs is a hobby site for us that came out of chats about how hard it is to find a good coffee in London. Both of us having come from Melbourne, it wasn&#39;t until we moved here that we realised how much we appreciate a good coffee. Seeing that there are millions of antipodeans living in the area we thought it might be of use to us and others to have somewhere to find, submit and rate good coffees.</p>

<p>This is a project that we are building in our own time and we aim to continually update and improve it. So, for now, jump on and have a look around. At the moment you can only search for venues, but in time we will add login and the ability to add and rate venues. And by all means, if you have any suggestions for us, please let us know.</p>

        <p>So, after many years of using SVN, and a few less years of hearing about distributed version control, I decided to try out Git on our new project. It&#39;s a bit of trial and error and I&#39;m still learning the differences and nuances between SVN and Git but I&#39;ve got to say that I&#39;m loving it. Below are a few thoughts about Git and things I&#39;m learning along the way.</p>

<p>Firstly, to date, my SVN experience has been 100% through a GUI, whether that be TortoiseSVN or Subclipse/Subversive. While plugins often make learning a tool easier, I believe that they really do abstract you away from the inner workings of a tool and save/stop you from understanding what is really going on under the covers. I hate not knowing what is going on behind the scenes so it is for this reason that I have decided to learn Git from the command line. While it can be a bit confusing and tiresome, and feel downright slow trying to understand a diff on the command line as opposed to two nice side by side windows, I think learning Git this way will definitely cement in my mind how it hangs together.</p>

<p>So, as we all know, SVN is a remote source control server that each developer pulls changes down from and pushes changes up to. There are a number of things that are frustrating about this method, some of which include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pulling a mass of changed files that are all related to different code changes when working with multiple developers</li>
<li>The frequency of pulling in code that breaks your build if not tested properly</li>
<li>Slow speed to pull down large groups of changes, comparing files with previous versions, switching branches etc</li>
<li>The frequency of merges going wrong, especially when merging lots of code between branches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Git, however, has a different model. Being distributed, there is no one master repository where the source code lives. Every developer has a local copy of the repository that contains every single commit since the repository was created. This allows the developer to commit code, create/switch branches, diff files, all within the local repository, without the need to be connected to a network. Once a developer is happy with their code, they are able to push their commits to a remote repository, be it a common remote repository such as one hosted on Github or another developer&#39;s local machine repository.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve been reading, the merging capabilities of Git far out weigh that of SVN as well. From what I can gather the difference between the two is quite large. My understanding is that SVN basically looks at the current revision of a file and the revision of the file to be merged and just merges the two lots of file contents. As you can imagine, this can leave you in a world of pain if multiple lines of the same code in both revisions have been changed by different people in different ways. Not to mention if code was deleted. This is often referred to as &#39;Merge Hell&#39;.</p>

<p>Git, on the other hand, tracks the actual changes that are made to a file from the very first point it was created. Each commit of a file knows about the parent commit. Therefore, Git can order a number of different commits and apply them to a file in sequential order massively reducing the merge conflicts experienced. At least, that&#39;s my basic understanding of it anyway.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m really liking the feel of Git, compared to SVN. Here are some of the commands that I use most frequently. I&#39;m recoring them here mainly so that I can reference them in the future, but also in case anyone out there is starting out with Git and wanting a nudge forward.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Create a repository</h3>

<p>The first thing you might want to do is create a local Git repository for a project you are working on. To do this, at a terminal prompt, move to the base directory of the project and run:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git init 
</code></pre>

<p>This will initialise the git repo for you. Exciting eh?  Or if you wanted to create a repo from a remote one, maybe on Github, you need to clone it like so:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git
</code></pre>

        <p>Seam 3 has been written in a very modularized way. It is basically CDI at it&#39;s core with a bunch of modules that give support for things like Transactions, Facelets, GWT, JBPM that can be tacked on to CDI as the developer sees fit. This is great as the Seam 2 stack contained all this stuff, a lot of which was not needed all the time. Now, with Seam 3, we can just pick and choose which modules we need.</p>

<p>Out of the box, CDI does not come with any container managed transaction (CMT) support. However, using the Seam 3 Persistence module you can add CMT support to your application.</p>

<p>This allows us to use annotations in our code to signify where transactions should begin.</p>

<p>The Seam Persistence module documentation can be found <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/seam/3/persistence/latest/reference/en-US/html/persistence.html" title="Seam Persistence documentation">here</a>.</p>

<p>The following is how I plugged the module in and a couple of gotchas I came up against.</p>

<p>Firstly, I needed to add the Seam Persistence jars to our project. I&#39;m using Maven 3, so the following are the dependency definitions </p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.seam.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;seam-persistence-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${seam.persistence.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.seam.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;seam-persistence-impl&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${seam.persistence.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.seam.solder&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;seam-solder&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${seam.solder.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
