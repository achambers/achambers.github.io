        <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/interview-linkdex">Interview @ Linkdex</a> <span class="date">2011-07-12</span></h3>

        <p>So, I&#39;ve just finished my last contract and am about to start looking into getting another, so I decided it might be a good idea to blog about the interview processes that I come across and the sorts of questions that I am given. This is mainly for my own record so that I can keep track of the sorts of questions that are being asked and the things I should keep fresh in my mind when going for future interviews, but also for anyone else who might be going for a job at one of these companies. So, without further ado, the latest interview I went for...</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The Company</h3>

<p>The company are a startup that&#39;s been around for a couple of years. Their product is basically a web based management and workflow tool for managing links to your website. It analyses your website and that of your competitors and allows you to see stats on your current and potential links. It also wraps this with a workflow engine to allow you to track tasks based around building new, and maintaining existing, links.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Interview #1 - The telephone interview (David)</h3>

<p>One of the easiest telephone interviews I&#39;ve ever had. There was basically zero technical questions and it was more of an informal chat. David and I chatted for about 45 minutes, discussing mainly the technology stack that the company use. David asked me only one question about my CV which was when he asked for some background on the project I undertook to implement Cassandra at my last place of work. He wanted to know a little about the drivers for the work and the outcomes. Other than that, we basically just had a chat about different technologies and chewed the fat about the company.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Interview #2 - The face to face (David, Martin)</h3>

<p>The first hour and a half of the interview was more of a technical nature with David. We sat in a room and went through a few technical type questions on a white board, followed by going into some detail about the workings of the company&#39;s system and some hypothetical situations based around how I would approach a particular piece of work.</p>

<p>First off David asked me to take a whiteboard marker and write a method that would reverse a String. I started out by telling him I&#39;d use the <code>StringBuffer#reverse</code> method, but understanding that that probably defeats the purpose of the question, went on to write something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>public String reverseIt(String myString) {
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(myString.length());

    for (int i = myString.length() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
        sb.append(myString.charAt(i));
    }

    return sb.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next David, asked me to write a generic class that modelled a key/value pair like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test&lt;KEY, VALUE&gt; {
    private KEY key;
    private VALUE value;
    public Test(KEY key, VALUE value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
    //...Getters
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then he asked me to improve that by making it a factory type class by putting a static build method on it. The point of this question was to see if I understood the concept that generic types defined at the class level cannot be seen by the static method. Hence:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test&lt;KEY, VALUE&gt; {
    private KEY key;
    private VALUE value;

    private Test (KEY key, VALUE value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public static &lt;KEY, VALUE&gt; Test build(KEY key, VALUE value) {
        return new Test(key, value);   
    }   

    //... Getters
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we did some SQL. David drew two tables on the board, the first, <code>Person (id, name, age, gender, address_id)</code> and the second, <code>Address (id, address)</code>. I had to write up a few select queries basied on the schema. The first one I think was along the lines of select all addresses along with the county of people at each one. The last I think was something like select all addresses along with the count of males and the count of females without doing any sub selects. Something along those lines anyway.</p>

<p>The final white board question was one of my favourites. It was simply to get an idea of whether I thought logically and how I went about problem solving. Basically, he drew an analogue clock face on the board without hands. He asked me to calculate the number of degrees of the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands when the clock shows the time as 4:40. The solution to this was pretty straight forward. A clock, 360 degrees, is made up of 12 segments, which are 30 degrees each. At 4:40, the minute hand is at 8 and the hour hand is 2/3 of the way between 4 and 5. This means that there is 1/3 of 30 degrees between the hour hand and 5 o&#39;clock which equals 10 degress. And there is 90 degrees between the 5 and 8. Therefore, there is 100 degress between the hour and minute hands. Easy peasy.</p>

<p>So, after some chatting about the Linkdex technology and other stuff, my interview with David was concluded and Martin came in to meet me.</p>

<p>Martin really just went through the business side of what Linkdex do and how they operate. He asked me a few questions about things on my CV such as which project would be most similar to how the company operate. He also asked which project I would have done differently and why. Finally Martin asked me a question that I wasn&#39;t expecting: <strong>If I have £100 at the start of the first year and £200 at the end of the second year, what is the annual interest rate?</strong></p>

<p>Now, this question kind of threw me off guard as I wasn&#39;t expecting it and I haven&#39;t thought too much about my interest calculation maths since high school. I also didn&#39;t think to ask probably the most important question, &#39;Is that simple or compound interest?&#39;. I was trying to work out the compound interest and got myself tied in a little knot. But I think Martin was actually after the simple interest which I could have told him in 2 secs. I guess I&#39;ll never know.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s about the extent of the interview. Overall not all that technical but there were a couple of nice logic questions in there.</p>

        <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/rvm">RVM</a> <span class="date">2011-05-24</span></h3>

        <p>I had a &#39;light bulb&#39; moment the other day when I actually understood the value of <a href="http://rvm.io" title="RVM">RVM</a>. Before then I was using it, but didn&#39;t really understand why and what value it was giving me. The reason for this was because I didn&#39;t really understand what it does and what it&#39;s trying to solve. I am no expert in RVM by any means but this is my understanding of RVM and why and how I use it.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">What is RVM?</h3>

<p>RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager. It basically allows you to manage multiple versions of Ruby on your system and more importantly, I think, it allows you to sandbox Ruby versions and gem sets so that each project can have it&#39;s own encapsulated environment with only the gems that are required. This will ultimately save you from dealing with sneaky versioning issues between gems and also allows you run apps against new version of Ruby and gems without upgrading your system version.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">How RVM works</h3>

<p>When you install Ruby to your system normally it is installed to a system directory like /user/bin/ruby for instance (on Mac OS X). When you install gems using the system version of Ruby/Rubygems they are all installed into the same system directory. This means that different versions of the same gem are installed into the same place and it also means that gems from across all projects that use that version of Ruby are installed into the same place. This can cause multiple hassles from gem version collisions to inconsistent environment set ups between development and staging/production.</p>

<p>RVM however, allows you to run multiple versions of Ruby with multiple gem sets all sandboxed in their own environment specific directory within RVM. For starters, RVM installs itself in the <code>~/.rvm</code> directory. This means that you no longer need to use <code>sudo</code> to install gems. This also means that from now on, any Ruby versions or gems you install are installed into the RVM directory and kept completely separate from your system installation of Ruby.</p>

<p>When you use RVM to switch to a particular version of Ruby and/or a particular gemset it essentially switches the PATH variables that point to the Ruby version and gems directory. From that point onwards, you use Ruby exactly as you normally would. It&#39;s a pretty simple concept when you think about it. But it is oh so powerful.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">How to install a Ruby version</h3>

<p>Once you have RVM installed (follow the instructions to do this on the website above), the first thing you will want to do is install a version of Ruby. First lets see which version of Ruby are available to us:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm list known
</code></pre>

<p>In this instance we&#39;ll install version 1.9.2-head by typing the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm install ruby-1.9.2-head
</code></pre>

<p>RVM has now installed our required version of Ruby and set it to be the current one. We can check this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm current
#=&gt; ruby-1.9.2-head
</code></pre>

<p>We can also see which other version of Ruby we have installed in RVM:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm list
#=&gt; ruby-1.9.2-p180 [ x86_64 ] 
#=&gt; ruby-1.9.2-head [ x86_64 ]
</code></pre>

<p>To switch to the other version of Ruby we would simply type the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm use ruby-1.9.2-p180
</code></pre>

<p>So what has actually happened when we installed this version of Ruby with RVM?  To get a better idea, let&#39;s have a look at the rvm info page:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm info
</code></pre>

<p>From the output we can see a few important things:</p>

<ul>
<li>RVM is using the version of Ruby, <code>ruby-1.9.2-p180</code>, which is installed in <code>[user home]/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180</code></li>
<li>The directory where gems are installed is <code>[user home]/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180</code></li>
<li>RVM has modified the PATH variable to include the path to the bin directory of the version of Ruby, the gem directory and also the global gem directory (which I will explain in more detail further down)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, everything to do with this version of Ruby is contained into it&#39;s own directory specific to that version of Ruby. Awesome!</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Gems and Gemsets</h3>

<p>RVM has the concept of Gemsets which is essentially a directory where gems are installed. This means for each version of Ruby we can create different gem sets. It wasn&#39;t until I started using Ruby across multiple projects that I understood the value of this. Gemsets essentially mean that for each project I have that is using Ruby version 1.9.2-head I can have a separate set of gems that are specific to each project. This means that there are going to be no collisions between gem versions used across different projects and there are also not going to be redundent gems used in one project but not in another. This is a great thing which also makes is super easy to have a sandboxed environment that can be easily replicated across different servers from development to staging/production.</p>

<p>Before looking closer at Gemsets it&#39;s important to note that there are 3 scopes of Gemset. There is the default gemset, global gemset and, for lack of a better word, specific gemset. </p>

<p>The default gemset is the gemset used when RVM is set to use a specific version of Ruby but no specific gemset. This gemset lives at <code>[rvm home]/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180</code>.</p>

<p>The specific gemset is the gemset that I would create for each project, for instance My Project might have a gemset called my_project. This will hold all gems specific to the project that will use it. This gemset lives at <code>[rvm home]/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@my_project</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the global gemset is a gemset that is available to all other gemsets within a ruby version. So any gems I install in the ruby-1.9.2-p180 global gemset will be available to all other specific gemsets as well as the default gemset. This gemset lives at <code>[rvm home]/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@global</code>.</p>

<p>So lets create our first gemset for our head version of Ruby:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm use ruby-1.9.2-head 
$ rvm gemset create my_project 
$ rvm use ruby-1.9.2-head@my_project 
</code></pre>

<p>We could also create and use that gemset in the same command:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rvm use --create ruby-1.9.2-head@my_project
</code></pre>

        <p>It has to be said, I am the type of person that gets very focussed on a particular subject. When in this focussed mode, I find it very difficult to look outside of my field of vision at other options as I&#39;m so focussed on achieving what is currently set out in front of me. Every now and then though, something will connect with me in the right way, at the right moment, that will allow me to open my eyes a little to a new idea or concept and it will change my thoughts and perception instantly.</p>

<p>This has been my history with many things including music, gadgets I want to buy, shows I like to watch, and programming languages.</p>

<p>The reason I bring this up is because up until a while ago Ruby was one of those things that I just didn&#39;t have an interest in looking at because I was too focussed on Java. I have been using Java for over 10 years and I am good at it. And I am focussed on continually getting better at it. That was until about 6 months ago when I was working in a team that used Ruby for testing their Java apps. It was at this point that the wonder of Ruby hit me from out of nowhere. I was temporarily distracted from Java and Ruby came in and blew me away. And now I can&#39;t stop thinking about it, to the extent that I don&#39;t want to waste any more time on Java. How the hell did this happen?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you how. </p>

<p>Over the space of a few weeks I was explained what Ruby is and how it works. I was shown the sexy and efficient syntax and how much more time efficient some of the constructs that are built into the language are than Java. I was shown how easy it is to get a basic RESTful &#39;Hello World&#39; app up and running, measured literally in seconds as opposed to minutes or hours in Java. I was shown the wonder of BDD with cucumber and how executable instructions written in plain english can make functional testing and bridging the gap between developers and product ownsers a pleasure. And, one of the most important things, I learnt and understood aspects about the under the covers of Ruby that I never knew, learnt or cared to learn about Java. And it all made sense. </p>

<p>All these things got me intrigued enough to wonder whether I should be looking harder into Ruby and whether Java really was the language I wanted to focus the majority of my time on. The feeling I was starting to get from those 6 months with Ruby was why am I using Java?  Ruby makes things so much easier, simpler and most importantly quicker. It is a pleasure to use Ruby. I was getting a feeling that I had not really ever experienced from Java. This made me want to learn more.</p>

<p>So, that is my quest at the moment. Ruby has stolen my focus for now. I am on a crusade to become great at it. I am not giving up on Java by any means, I am mearly expanding my toolkit. But I think, for now, I&#39;m aiming on moving my Java hammer to the side and hanging the shiny new Ruby one in the center of the tool shed. </p>

<p>Side Note: It&#39;s funny because over the years I have heard countless stories of developers working in a Java role who would always bang on about Ruby and bust it out to automate different small tasks. I never understood why. Now I do. And I think I&#39;m turning into one of them :)</p>

        <p>So, that little project that <a href="http://liquidarmour.biz/" title="Liquid Armour">Liquid Armour</a> and I have been working on has finally started to see the light of day. The site is called CoffeeSnobs and can be found at <a href="http://coffeesnobs.in/london" title="CoffeeSnobs">http://coffeesnobs.in/london</a> . It is a work in progress and we&#39;ll be constantly improving the site as we go.</p>

<p>CoffeeSnobs is a hobby site for us that came out of chats about how hard it is to find a good coffee in London. Both of us having come from Melbourne, it wasn&#39;t until we moved here that we realised how much we appreciate a good coffee. Seeing that there are millions of antipodeans living in the area we thought it might be of use to us and others to have somewhere to find, submit and rate good coffees.</p>

<p>This is a project that we are building in our own time and we aim to continually update and improve it. So, for now, jump on and have a look around. At the moment you can only search for venues, but in time we will add login and the ability to add and rate venues. And by all means, if you have any suggestions for us, please let us know.</p>

        <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/git-rid-of-svn">GIT rid of SVN</a> <span class="date">2011-02-02</span></h3>

        <p>So, after many years of using SVN, and a few less years of hearing about distributed version control, I decided to try out Git on our new project. It&#39;s a bit of trial and error and I&#39;m still learning the differences and nuances between SVN and Git but I&#39;ve got to say that I&#39;m loving it. Below are a few thoughts about Git and things I&#39;m learning along the way.</p>

<p>Firstly, to date, my SVN experience has been 100% through a GUI, whether that be TortoiseSVN or Subclipse/Subversive. While plugins often make learning a tool easier, I believe that they really do abstract you away from the inner workings of a tool and save/stop you from understanding what is really going on under the covers. I hate not knowing what is going on behind the scenes so it is for this reason that I have decided to learn Git from the command line. While it can be a bit confusing and tiresome, and feel downright slow trying to understand a diff on the command line as opposed to two nice side by side windows, I think learning Git this way will definitely cement in my mind how it hangs together.</p>

<p>So, as we all know, SVN is a remote source control server that each developer pulls changes down from and pushes changes up to. There are a number of things that are frustrating about this method, some of which include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pulling a mass of changed files that are all related to different code changes when working with multiple developers</li>
<li>The frequency of pulling in code that breaks your build if not tested properly</li>
<li>Slow speed to pull down large groups of changes, comparing files with previous versions, switching branches etc</li>
<li>The frequency of merges going wrong, especially when merging lots of code between branches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Git, however, has a different model. Being distributed, there is no one master repository where the source code lives. Every developer has a local copy of the repository that contains every single commit since the repository was created. This allows the developer to commit code, create/switch branches, diff files, all within the local repository, without the need to be connected to a network. Once a developer is happy with their code, they are able to push their commits to a remote repository, be it a common remote repository such as one hosted on Github or another developer&#39;s local machine repository.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve been reading, the merging capabilities of Git far out weigh that of SVN as well. From what I can gather the difference between the two is quite large. My understanding is that SVN basically looks at the current revision of a file and the revision of the file to be merged and just merges the two lots of file contents. As you can imagine, this can leave you in a world of pain if multiple lines of the same code in both revisions have been changed by different people in different ways. Not to mention if code was deleted. This is often referred to as &#39;Merge Hell&#39;.</p>

<p>Git, on the other hand, tracks the actual changes that are made to a file from the very first point it was created. Each commit of a file knows about the parent commit. Therefore, Git can order a number of different commits and apply them to a file in sequential order massively reducing the merge conflicts experienced. At least, that&#39;s my basic understanding of it anyway.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m really liking the feel of Git, compared to SVN. Here are some of the commands that I use most frequently. I&#39;m recoring them here mainly so that I can reference them in the future, but also in case anyone out there is starting out with Git and wanting a nudge forward.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Create a repository</h3>

<p>The first thing you might want to do is create a local Git repository for a project you are working on. To do this, at a terminal prompt, move to the base directory of the project and run:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git init 
</code></pre>

<p>This will initialise the git repo for you. Exciting eh?  Or if you wanted to create a repo from a remote one, maybe on Github, you need to clone it like so:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git
</code></pre>

<p>This will pull down everything within the repo specified, including the history of every commit ever made since the project was first created. It will also update your git project config so that it knows that your local repo is linked to that remote repo, which Git will call <code>origin</code>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Committing files</h3>

<p>Once you have new/modified files in your Git repo, whether it be the initial commit, or a bug fix to code on a shared project you cloned, you&#39;re going to want to commit them to your repo.</p>

<p>From here you can run the following command to see the status of your repo, showing which files you have modified or added to the index:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git status 
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out any files that are currently untracked by Git, and any files that have been modified since the last commit. In the case of the newly create Git repo, everything will be untracked. To add everything to the index, run the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git add .
</code></pre>

<p>Running the <code>git status</code> command now will show you that Git is now tracking your project files but they are uncommitted. To commit the files, just use the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git commit -m &#39;Enter commit comment here&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>It just keeps getting easier doesn&#39;t it?  This command is obviously going to commit your files to your local repo. The -m flag allows you to add a comment. Missing this flag, Git would prompt you for a commit comment.</p>

<p>It is really important, at this stage, to understand that at this point you have only commited changes to your local repo. If you have cloned a remote repo, you have not yet made any changes to that repo. They are all local to your environment and no one can get to them. This is the beauty of a distributed version control system. You can commit files until your heart is content and you do not need to be connected to any network and will not affect the code that anyone else is working on. Not until you are ready to push your changes to a remote repo.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Pushing files</h3>

<p>Speaking of pushing to a remote repo, maybe we should do that. First we want to ensure that we have the most up to date code from that remote repo. This is easily done by running the following commands:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git fetch origin
</code></pre>

<p>This will fetch any changes from the remote repo. Before merging them into our repo, we should probably diff them to have a look at what has changed</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git diff origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Once happy with changes that we will be merging into our repo, we do the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git merge origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have the latest code, it&#39;s time to push our changes up to the remote repo. Simply do the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s as easy as that.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Branching</h3>

<p>One thing I love about Git is how easy and quick branching is. For some reason, I hardly do it in SVN because it just feels clunky and slow. And switching code branches takes time and, for some reason, I am never confident that Eclipse switched branches properly and that there aren&#39;t files lying around from the previous branch. Anyway, with Git, I never have these worries. Switching branches is so easy and so damn quick.</p>
