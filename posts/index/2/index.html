        <p>A wise man once said &quot;Java will enrage, Ruby will enlighten&quot;. I&#39;ve been on the path of &quot;enragement&quot; for the past 10 years or so but a few months ago I found the start of the path to elightenment. And it is called <a href="http://rubykoans.com/" title="Ruby Koans">Ruby Koans</a>.</p>

<p>Even though I found out about Ruby Koans months ago, I came across it again the other day on my mac and had another play around with it and it made me want to write a short blog post on it. It&#39;s a great way to learn Ruby.</p>

<p>Ruby Koans is basically an interactive Ruby tutorial that guides one from the darkness of Ruby ignorance through the path to Ruby enlightenment. It is basically a series of Ruby files each covering different aspects of the Ruby programming language such as arrays, blocks, exceptions, modules, symbols etc etc.  Each file is essentially a number of tests covering specific topics that are initialised to fail. As you run Ruby Koans, you will go through each test, fixing it to make it pass and in turn learning something new about the Ruby language.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very simple concept but it is effective. If you are new to Ruby, or even if you&#39;re an expert, have a play with Ruby Koans and let me know what you think.</p>

        <p>I just created a public repo on GitHub to store a basic boilerplate Ruby project so that I don&#39;t always need to recreate the basics from scratch. I&#39;m in two minds about this. </p>

<p>In one way I think it&#39;s handy because there is a bit of chuff that needs to happen at the start of every project and this is a good way to minimise having to recreate it every time. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I think a project&#39;s structure is never complete and always changes. I believe you should always look for ways to improve and refactor your code to make it easier to understand and feel more &#39;right&#39;. By constantly using the same boilerplate project this may stop one from thinking of better ways to start off the project. However, this is a very minimal boilerplate project and really is just used to get up and running.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll see how it goes and will continue to improve it. And if anyone would like to make any suggestions, or make the changes themselves and create a Pull Request, go ahead.</p>

        <p>So, I&#39;m spending a couple of hours on an unattended test for a contract that I&#39;m thinking of going for and I have to write a bit of Java code that simulates some ATM software. While churning out a couple of methods I had my very first &#39;Man, this would be so much easier in Ruby&#39; moment and it put a smile on my face to know that this is the first of many more to come. I know the Ruby syntax is a lot less verbose than Java and has a lot of niceties that Java doesn&#39;t but it&#39;s so nice to be in the real world and just see it in action.</p>

<p>So, I needed to write a method that would throw an exception if an account had insufficient funds to make a withdrawal. It looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public Account withdraw(long accountNumber, BigDecimal withdrawalAmount) {
  Account account = accountDao.get(accountNumber);

  if(!account.hasSufficientFunds(withdrawalAmount)) {
    throw new InsufficientFundsException();
  }

  //some code here

  return account;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And it just got me thinking how it&#39;s so crap that I need to negate the hasSufficientFunds method. You spend all this time making easy to read method names, making sure they are written in the affirmative and convey what they do and then you have to go and negate it by adding a damn question mark to it to confuse everything. It&#39;s just putting extra pressure on your brain to parse everything. Java, it doesn&#39;t need to be that hard....if only you had syntax like Ruby. I found myself wishing I could write the method like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def withdraw account_number, withdrawal_amount do
  account = Account.find account_number

  unless account.sufficient_funds? withdrawal_amount do
    raise &quot;Insufficient funds&quot;
  end    

  #...more code...
end
</code></pre>

        <p>It&#39;s been a few weeks since I&#39;ve committed any code to CoffeeSnobs. I have been spending my time working on the design, look and feel mostly, as well as working on another project.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when I went to run CoffeeSnobs locally to implement the new look and feel, for some reason I got the following exception when starting the server:</p>

<pre><code class="java">Caused by: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Illegal class name &quot;org/jboss/seam/security/management/action/org$jboss$weld$bean-jboss$classloader:id=&quot;vfs:$$$Applications$servers$jboss-6$0$0$Final$server$default$deploy$coffee-snobs-jee6$war&quot;-ManagedBean-org$jboss$seam$security$management$action$GroupAction[@javax$enterprise$context$ConversationScoped()@javax$inject$Named(value=)]{org$jboss$seam$security$management$action$GroupAction$conversation[@javax$inject$Inject()]$org$jboss$seam$security$management$action$GroupAction$identitySession[@javax$inject$Inject()]$org$jboss$seam$security$management$action$GroupAction$deleteGroup[@org$jboss$seam$transaction$Transactional(value=REQUIRED)@org$jboss$seam$transaction$TransactionalInterceptorBinding()](java$lang$String,java$lang$String)$org$jboss$seam$security$management$action$GroupAction$save[@org$jboss$seam$transaction$Transactional(value=REQUIRED)@org$jboss$seam$transaction$TransactionalInterceptorBinding()]()$}_$$_WeldSubclass&quot; in class file org/jboss/seam/security/management/action/org$jboss$weld$bean-jboss

<p>Now, the weird thing here that I have not made any changes since the last time I ran the project and committed code. And it worked then. </p>

<p>So I did a little bit of searching and found the following forum post which seems to have fixed the problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://seamframework.org/Community/IllegalClassNameException" title="Forum Post">http://seamframework.org/Community/IllegalClassNameException</a></p>

<p>The problem seems to be in regards to the version of the Weld jar in the Jboss AS server. Although, I have no idea why this used to work and then all of a sudden stopped. Anyway, the solution is as follows (by the way, I have Jboss AS 6.0.0Final installed on Mac OSX Snow Leopard):</p>

<p>Go to <code>$JBOSS_HOME/server/&lt;whatever&gt;/deployers/weld.deployer/</code> and delete the file called <code>weld-core-no-jsf.jar</code>.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

        <p>So, I&#39;ve just finished my last contract and am about to start looking into getting another, so I decided it might be a good idea to blog about the interview processes that I come across and the sorts of questions that I am given. This is mainly for my own record so that I can keep track of the sorts of questions that are being asked and the things I should keep fresh in my mind when going for future interviews, but also for anyone else who might be going for a job at one of these companies. So, without further ado, the latest interview I went for...</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The Company</h3>

<p>The company are a startup that&#39;s been around for a couple of years. Their product is basically a web based management and workflow tool for managing links to your website. It analyses your website and that of your competitors and allows you to see stats on your current and potential links. It also wraps this with a workflow engine to allow you to track tasks based around building new, and maintaining existing, links.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Interview #1 - The telephone interview (David)</h3>

<p>One of the easiest telephone interviews I&#39;ve ever had. There was basically zero technical questions and it was more of an informal chat. David and I chatted for about 45 minutes, discussing mainly the technology stack that the company use. David asked me only one question about my CV which was when he asked for some background on the project I undertook to implement Cassandra at my last place of work. He wanted to know a little about the drivers for the work and the outcomes. Other than that, we basically just had a chat about different technologies and chewed the fat about the company.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Interview #2 - The face to face (David, Martin)</h3>

<p>The first hour and a half of the interview was more of a technical nature with David. We sat in a room and went through a few technical type questions on a white board, followed by going into some detail about the workings of the company&#39;s system and some hypothetical situations based around how I would approach a particular piece of work.</p>

<p>First off David asked me to take a whiteboard marker and write a method that would reverse a String. I started out by telling him I&#39;d use the <code>StringBuffer#reverse</code> method, but understanding that that probably defeats the purpose of the question, went on to write something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>public String reverseIt(String myString) {
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(myString.length());

    for (int i = myString.length() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
        sb.append(myString.charAt(i));
    }

    return sb.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next David, asked me to write a generic class that modelled a key/value pair like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test&lt;KEY, VALUE&gt; {
    private KEY key;
    private VALUE value;
    public Test(KEY key, VALUE value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
    //...Getters
}
</code></pre>
