        <p>So I got a call from a recruiter this morning. The call started off as normal. &quot;<strong>Hi, this is David Dowdall blah blah blah. I have some roles in the Finance industry I think you&#39;ll be interested in blah blah blah</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>So, I stopped David there to tell him that I&#39;m not interested in the finance industry and this is where it started to turn a bit strange. And by that I mean I started to get a feeling that David was taking me for a fool.</p>

<p>David started banging on about something along the lines of needing to confirm some details with me for secuirty reasons. Security reasons?  Do you have a top secret role for me in the NSA?  He needed to confirm my name and last 2 places of work, and really needed my line manager&#39;s name and contact details as references so that my CV would look credible and the client would look favourably on my application.</p>

<p>Now HOLD ON THERE David. What client?  What application?  You haven&#39;t even mentioned any role to me and I sure has hell haven&#39;t asked you to put me forward for it.</p>

<p>He went on to ask for details on the interviews that I have coming up. And of course that was for my benefit as well so that he wouldn&#39;t put me forward for any of the same companies. Again, HOLD YOUR HORSES David. There won&#39;t be any problem of that happening either because you won&#39;t be putting me forward for anything without me giving you permission first.</p>

<p>So, after our conversation where David was obviously digging for leads and obviously had no roles for me, I received an email from him. It went as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Aaron,
<br/><br/>
Many thanks for your time. 
Please click here to enter your references from your most recent employers. It would be good, where possible, to show them to
companies that are interested in you. This will really help you get the position you want as it creates credibility with your
application.
<br/><br/>
Ideally the references you give will be/have been, your direct line manager at the company. Include your current/most recent
employer; however they will not be approached without your prior written permission.
<br/><br/>
In addition, in reply to this email, it is important that you keep me updated with any details of where you have sent your CV
and where you have been/are going for interview. This includes company applied for, location, role applied for and manager&#39;s
name if possible.
<br/><br/>
This is so that any applications I make on your behalf will not damage any pre-existing applications, this will save wasting
your time and help me work faster.
<br/><br/>
Finally, please keep me up to date with your employment situation i.e. interviews or job offers as it would be unfair to put
you forward to anyone should your situation change.
<br/><br/>
Speak to you soon,
<br/><br/>
David Dowdall<br>
Senior Recruitment Consultant<br>
Evolution Recruitment Solutions Ltd  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not only do I need to go to a page on their website and input the contact details of two of my references, before even having a role to interview for but I need to keep David updated with where I send my CV, where I have been and am going for interviews including the company and interviewing manager&#39;s name.</p>

<p>And I need to do all of this for <strong>MY</strong> benefit apparently. Sounds so fishy it isn&#39;t funny.</p>

<p>Funnily enough I had a read through this <a href="http://www.contractoruk.com/agencies/agency_tricks_on_it_contractors_still_common.html" title="Contractor UK">link</a> on Contractor UK and it describes a few tactics very similar to what David displayed in his interactions with me today. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to say, this is the first time I have had this sort of contact from a recruiter and the first time that I hung up the phone feeling like the recruiter was blatantly trying to dupe me.</p>

<p>Maybe I have all this wrong and please correct me if I do, but I won&#39;t be giving any information to David or Evolution Recruitment now or in the future.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>A quick search turned up this <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/daviddowdalljava" title="David Dowdall LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> profile which one would assume belongs to the same David that was in contact with me. From that page, it looks like David has only been working at Evolution Recruitment for a month, or less. So David, you&#39;re new to the position and need to build up some leads. Fair enough. But don&#39;t take me as a fool mate.</p>

        <p>A wise man once said &quot;Java will enrage, Ruby will enlighten&quot;. I&#39;ve been on the path of &quot;enragement&quot; for the past 10 years or so but a few months ago I found the start of the path to elightenment. And it is called <a href="http://rubykoans.com/" title="Ruby Koans">Ruby Koans</a>.</p>

<p>Even though I found out about Ruby Koans months ago, I came across it again the other day on my mac and had another play around with it and it made me want to write a short blog post on it. It&#39;s a great way to learn Ruby.</p>

<p>Ruby Koans is basically an interactive Ruby tutorial that guides one from the darkness of Ruby ignorance through the path to Ruby enlightenment. It is basically a series of Ruby files each covering different aspects of the Ruby programming language such as arrays, blocks, exceptions, modules, symbols etc etc.  Each file is essentially a number of tests covering specific topics that are initialised to fail. As you run Ruby Koans, you will go through each test, fixing it to make it pass and in turn learning something new about the Ruby language.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very simple concept but it is effective. If you are new to Ruby, or even if you&#39;re an expert, have a play with Ruby Koans and let me know what you think.</p>

        <p>I just created a public repo on GitHub to store a basic boilerplate Ruby project so that I don&#39;t always need to recreate the basics from scratch. I&#39;m in two minds about this. </p>

<p>In one way I think it&#39;s handy because there is a bit of chuff that needs to happen at the start of every project and this is a good way to minimise having to recreate it every time. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I think a project&#39;s structure is never complete and always changes. I believe you should always look for ways to improve and refactor your code to make it easier to understand and feel more &#39;right&#39;. By constantly using the same boilerplate project this may stop one from thinking of better ways to start off the project. However, this is a very minimal boilerplate project and really is just used to get up and running.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll see how it goes and will continue to improve it. And if anyone would like to make any suggestions, or make the changes themselves and create a Pull Request, go ahead.</p>

        <p>So, I&#39;m spending a couple of hours on an unattended test for a contract that I&#39;m thinking of going for and I have to write a bit of Java code that simulates some ATM software. While churning out a couple of methods I had my very first &#39;Man, this would be so much easier in Ruby&#39; moment and it put a smile on my face to know that this is the first of many more to come. I know the Ruby syntax is a lot less verbose than Java and has a lot of niceties that Java doesn&#39;t but it&#39;s so nice to be in the real world and just see it in action.</p>

<p>So, I needed to write a method that would throw an exception if an account had insufficient funds to make a withdrawal. It looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public Account withdraw(long accountNumber, BigDecimal withdrawalAmount) {
  Account account = accountDao.get(accountNumber);

  if(!account.hasSufficientFunds(withdrawalAmount)) {
    throw new InsufficientFundsException();
  }

  //some code here

  return account;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And it just got me thinking how it&#39;s so crap that I need to negate the hasSufficientFunds method. You spend all this time making easy to read method names, making sure they are written in the affirmative and convey what they do and then you have to go and negate it by adding a damn question mark to it to confuse everything. It&#39;s just putting extra pressure on your brain to parse everything. Java, it doesn&#39;t need to be that hard....if only you had syntax like Ruby. I found myself wishing I could write the method like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def withdraw account_number, withdrawal_amount do
  account = Account.find account_number

  unless account.sufficient_funds? withdrawal_amount do
    raise &quot;Insufficient funds&quot;
  end    

  #...more code...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sooo much nicer....Soooo much sexier</p>

        <p>It&#39;s been a few weeks since I&#39;ve committed any code to CoffeeSnobs. I have been spending my time working on the design, look and feel mostly, as well as working on another project.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when I went to run CoffeeSnobs locally to implement the new look and feel, for some reason I got the following exception when starting the server:</p>

<p>Now, the weird thing here that I have not made any changes since the last time I ran the project and committed code. And it worked then. </p>

<p>So I did a little bit of searching and found the following forum post which seems to have fixed the problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://seamframework.org/Community/IllegalClassNameException" title="Forum Post">http://seamframework.org/Community/IllegalClassNameException</a></p>

<p>The problem seems to be in regards to the version of the Weld jar in the Jboss AS server. Although, I have no idea why this used to work and then all of a sudden stopped. Anyway, the solution is as follows (by the way, I have Jboss AS 6.0.0Final installed on Mac OSX Snow Leopard):</p>

<p>Go to <code>$JBOSS_HOME/server/&lt;whatever&gt;/deployers/weld.deployer/</code> and delete the file called <code>weld-core-no-jsf.jar</code>.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p>Download <code>https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/org/jboss/weld...</code> and copy it into the above directory</p>

<p>And there you have it. All fixed.</p>
