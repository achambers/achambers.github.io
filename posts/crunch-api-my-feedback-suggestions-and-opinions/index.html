      <p>Hey Crunch Team, just had a bit of a squiz over <a href="http://support.crunch.co.uk/attachments/token/t6tkagiuvv95esz/?name=Crunch_API.pdf" title="Crunch API Documentation">your new your API</a> and wanted to put forward some feedback, suggestions and a few opinions.</p>

<p>Now, everything following this is based on my understanding of the REST spec, my beliefs of how a RESTful API should be designed and any opinions I have along the way.</p>

<p>I basically skipped over the OAuth stuff and on to the endpoints which is what interests me the most, so let&#39;s get started.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Naming</h3>

<p>The way I look at a RESTful resource URI is similar to how I look at a folder structure on a file system. On my filesystem, in my <code>suppliers</code> folder, I might have a list of suppliers listed by <code>id</code>. Inside each <code>id</code> folder I have any folders and data that correspond to the specific supplier.</p>

<p>So, if we take a look at your services to get a list of suppliers and expenses...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/suppliers<br>
/rest/api/expenses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...things look pretty good. To get a list of my suppliers, I look in my <code>suppliers</code> folder. Likewise, for my expenses, I look in my <code>expenses</code> folder. So far so good.</p>

<p>However, now let&#39;s take a look at the services behind GETting a specific supplier or expense:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/supplier/{id}<br>
/rest/api/expense/{id}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where I think things start to fall down a little. What you have done here is tell me that there is a folder, or resource if you will, called supplier, at the same level as the suppliers/expenses folder. And you are also telling me that I will find the supplier/expense for a specific ID in this folder.</p>

<p>What I would actually expect to find is a specific supplier underneath the <code>suppliers</code> folder on my filesystem...wouldn&#39;t I? Maybe something like this is more appropriate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rest/api/supplier<strong>s</strong>/{id}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the <code>s</code>? It is a very small point, and it&#39;s all semantics, however, I still think it&#39;s important. The supplier I want is in the list of suppliers that lives inside the <code>suppliers</code> folder.</p>

<p>Next up, lets have a quick look at:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expense/expenseTypes<br>
/rest/api/expense/paymentMethods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, if we follow the folder theme, it doesn&#39;t, in my mind, make sense that I would look in the expense folder to find a list of possible expenseTypes or paymentMethods. To me, I would have my <code>expenses</code> folder which contained my list of expenses and then when I wanted to find the possible list of expenseTypes, I&#39;d probably find that in it&#39;s own folder at the top level like so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expense_types</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, I&#39;d probably do the same thing with payment methods:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/payment_methods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason behind this is they are, in a way, top level resources. They don&#39;t live as subordinates of an expense, or anything else really.</p>

<p>Now on to accounts. Let&#39;s have a look at your current URI&#39;s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/accounts/allAccounts<br>
/rest/api/accounts/bankAccounts<br>
/rest/api/accounts/creditCards</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking back to the folder analogy, on my filesystem, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d arrange my accounts in <code>allAccounts</code>, <code>bankAccounts</code> and <code>creditCards</code> folders underneath an <code>accounts</code> folder. That doesn&#39;t really make sense to me. In my mind it would make more sense to have all my accounts sitting inside the <code>accounts</code> folder and each account would have a type. So when I want to get a list of all my accounts I&#39;d probably go to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/accounts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I wanted only accounts that were bank accounts, I&#39;d probably look for accounts, in the <code>accounts</code> folder that have a type <code>bankAccount</code> like so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/accounts?type=bank_account</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, I&#39;d do something similar if I wanted credit card accounts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/accounts?type=credit_card</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the payload that is returned, I&#39;d probably then expect something like so:</p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;accounts&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;bank_account&quot;&gt;Bank Account 1&lt;/account&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;bank_account&quot;&gt;Bank Account 2&lt;/account&gt; 
&lt;/accounts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;accounts&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;credit_card&quot;&gt;Credit Card 1&lt;/account&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;4&quot; type=&quot;credit_card&quot;&gt;Credit Card 2&lt;/account&gt; 
&lt;/accounts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This then allows you to return all accounts to me with:</p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;accounts&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;bank_account&quot;&gt;Bank Account 1&lt;/account&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;bank_account&quot;&gt;Bank Account 2&lt;/account&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;credit_card&quot;&gt;Credit Card 1&lt;/account&gt;
  &lt;account  accountId=&quot;4&quot; type=&quot;credit_card&quot;&gt;Credit Card 2&lt;/account&gt; 
&lt;/accounts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, these are pretty small semantic changes but I think they make for a much more readable, logical and understandable API. Obviously I don&#39;t know your data model or how these accounts relate to each other but this makes sense to me from the perspective of a consumer of your service. </p>

<h3 id="toc_1">PUT vs POST</h3>

<p><code>PUT</code> vs <code>POST</code> is something that confuses pretty much everyone I talk to when they first start learning about REST. And the fact is that there is nothing stopping a developer from implementing <code>PUT</code> and <code>POST</code> methods for their services incorrectly.</p>

<p>First let&#39;s look at the specification for <code>PUT</code> vs <code>POST</code> as per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 Spec">w3.org website</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request
as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this essentially means is that when you <code>POST</code> an entity to a particular URI, the server should create a new object underneath the requested resource URI, or inside the folder requested. And the response should return the location of the newly created resource. So, as an example, when I <code>POST</code> an entity to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expenses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The server should create a new expense underneath the <code>expenses</code> resource, or folder, and return me the resource location for it, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expenses/1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I were to <code>POST</code> the exact same entity to the exact same resource, a new entity would be created and the location for that would be returned, ie:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expenses/2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what is meant by the fact that the <code>POST</code> method is not idempotent. Each time you call the method, even with the same payload, a new resource is created on the server. And when thinking of the <code>POST</code> method like this, the naming of your GET methods, like I proposed, for specific expenses and accounts starts to make sense.</p>

<p>And now lets look at <code>PUT</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this essentially means is that when you <code>PUT</code> an entity to a particular URI, the server stores that entity at the specified URI. So if I wanted to create a new expense with a specific ID, or I wanted to update an existing expense for which I know the ID, I would <code>PUT</code> it to, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expenses/2</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>PUT</code> is idempotent meaning that I can <code>PUT</code> to that URI all day and there will be no change to the server state for each subsequent call after the first. I will essentially be saving the same expense over itself for each subsequent call.</p>

<p>Taking all this in to account, I want to put it out there that I think your API for adding an expense and a supplier is slightly wrong. At the moment you are allowing a user to <code>PUT</code> to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/supplier<br>
/rest/api/expense</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the REST spec, this would create the entity at that actual resource URI. Instead, you should, technically, only be able to <code>POST</code> to that URI. If you want to support <code>PUT</code>, that should really be to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/suppliers/{id}<br>
/rest/api/expenses/{id}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would essentially be allowing a user to update a particular supplier or expense for the ID specified.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Casing of URIs</h3>

<p>Casing of URI&#39;s comes down to personal preference, however, it is important to note that URI&#39;s are case sensitive. Therefore, it might be worth thinking about lower casing your URI&#39;s (as I sort of snuck in in the section about expenseTypes and paymentMethods) as it stops the user having to think about whether or not a particular resource URI contains upper case characters or not. If you stick soley to lower case, then there won&#39;t be any problems with that. Again, this is down to personal preference, so what you go with is up to you.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Typo</h3>

<p>A small cut and paste error, I&#39;m sure, but under the <strong>Add Expense</strong> section you refer to the <strong>Add Supplier service</strong>. Might want to fix that up ;)</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Just to re-iterate, the feedback and suggestions I have for you as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at your naming of URI&#39;s. Think of them like a folder structure on the filesystem.</li>
<li>Understand PUT vs POST and ensure that you implement them correctly.</li>
<li>Thinking about casing of URI&#39;s</li>
<li>Fix the typo</li>
</ol>

<p>Woah, looking back now, this post became way longer than I had imagined it would be. I hope I haven&#39;t ranted too much. As I mentioned at the beginning, all the things I raised are things that sprung to mind while reading your API doc that maybe I would have done differently if I were designing the services. Take them all with a pinch of salt but please have a think about them. In particular the <code>PUT</code> vs <code>POST</code> one. Along with that, it&#39;s true, I am only human and therefore I am only speaking based on my experiences as a developer. I have been known to be wrong more times than I could ever remember and there is every chance that I have been wrong in some points above, however, if I can do nothing more than open up some discussion and give you something to think about then I&#39;m happy.</p>

<p>Good work on what you have done with the API and the Crunch app. I have nothing but great things to say about your work and your company so keep up the awesomeness.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, Helena is a freaking awesome account manager.</p>
