Welcome stranger. Some how you've found my blog. Hopefully it's because future me has written some amazingly interesting posts that discuss some controversial topics, debates many threories and solves many problems in the world of technology and programming. At least that's what present me is aiming for, so hopefully future me comes through with the goods.

So, on behalf of both present and future me, welcome to the brain dumps of the techy side of my life.

I think there are a few reasons why I've been wanting to start this blog, ranging from getting myself out onto the internet in a constructive way, sharing my knowledge and experiences with other developers, branding myself, and also just as a place to store and remember things I learn along the way.

I am a Web Developer, currently living in London. I primarily work in the Java web space but am interested in technologies of all shapes and sizes. When I'm not constantly trying to think up new web app ideas, I'm dabbling in Rails in my own time along with building a little side project with one of my mates. More will be revealed along the way on that one.

Anyway, I'd better get working so that future me has something to post in the not to distant future.

Cheers,

Present Me
