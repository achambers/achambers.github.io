So, that little project that [Liquid Armour][1] and I have been working on has finally started to see the light of day. The site is called CoffeeSnobs and can be found at [http://coffeesnobs.in/london][2] . It is a work in progress and we'll be constantly improving the site as we go.

CoffeeSnobs is a hobby site for us that came out of chats about how hard it is to find a good coffee in London. Both of us having come from Melbourne, it wasn't until we moved here that we realised how much we appreciate a good coffee. Seeing that there are millions of antipodeans living in the area we thought it might be of use to us and others to have somewhere to find, submit and rate good coffees.

This is a project that we are building in our own time and we aim to continually update and improve it. So, for now, jump on and have a look around. At the moment you can only search for venues, but in time we will add login and the ability to add and rate venues. And by all means, if you have any suggestions for us, please let us know.
