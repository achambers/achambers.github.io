      <p>So I got a call from a recruiter this morning. The call started off as normal. &quot;<strong>Hi, this is David Dowdall blah blah blah. I have some roles in the Finance industry I think you&#39;ll be interested in blah blah blah</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>So, I stopped David there to tell him that I&#39;m not interested in the finance industry and this is where it started to turn a bit strange. And by that I mean I started to get a feeling that David was taking me for a fool.</p>

<p>David started banging on about something along the lines of needing to confirm some details with me for secuirty reasons. Security reasons?  Do you have a top secret role for me in the NSA?  He needed to confirm my name and last 2 places of work, and really needed my line manager&#39;s name and contact details as references so that my CV would look credible and the client would look favourably on my application.</p>

<p>Now HOLD ON THERE David. What client?  What application?  You haven&#39;t even mentioned any role to me and I sure has hell haven&#39;t asked you to put me forward for it.</p>

<p>He went on to ask for details on the interviews that I have coming up. And of course that was for my benefit as well so that he wouldn&#39;t put me forward for any of the same companies. Again, HOLD YOUR HORSES David. There won&#39;t be any problem of that happening either because you won&#39;t be putting me forward for anything without me giving you permission first.</p>

<p>So, after our conversation where David was obviously digging for leads and obviously had no roles for me, I received an email from him. It went as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Aaron,
<br/><br/>
Many thanks for your time. 
Please click here to enter your references from your most recent employers. It would be good, where possible, to show them to
companies that are interested in you. This will really help you get the position you want as it creates credibility with your
application.
<br/><br/>
Ideally the references you give will be/have been, your direct line manager at the company. Include your current/most recent
employer; however they will not be approached without your prior written permission.
<br/><br/>
In addition, in reply to this email, it is important that you keep me updated with any details of where you have sent your CV
and where you have been/are going for interview. This includes company applied for, location, role applied for and manager&#39;s
name if possible.
<br/><br/>
This is so that any applications I make on your behalf will not damage any pre-existing applications, this will save wasting
your time and help me work faster.
<br/><br/>
Finally, please keep me up to date with your employment situation i.e. interviews or job offers as it would be unfair to put
you forward to anyone should your situation change.
<br/><br/>
Speak to you soon,
<br/><br/>
David Dowdall<br>
Senior Recruitment Consultant<br>
Evolution Recruitment Solutions Ltd  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not only do I need to go to a page on their website and input the contact details of two of my references, before even having a role to interview for but I need to keep David updated with where I send my CV, where I have been and am going for interviews including the company and interviewing manager&#39;s name.</p>

<p>And I need to do all of this for <strong>MY</strong> benefit apparently. Sounds so fishy it isn&#39;t funny.</p>

<p>Funnily enough I had a read through this <a href="http://www.contractoruk.com/agencies/agency_tricks_on_it_contractors_still_common.html" title="Contractor UK">link</a> on Contractor UK and it describes a few tactics very similar to what David displayed in his interactions with me today. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to say, this is the first time I have had this sort of contact from a recruiter and the first time that I hung up the phone feeling like the recruiter was blatantly trying to dupe me.</p>

<p>Maybe I have all this wrong and please correct me if I do, but I won&#39;t be giving any information to David or Evolution Recruitment now or in the future.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>A quick search turned up this <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/daviddowdalljava" title="David Dowdall LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> profile which one would assume belongs to the same David that was in contact with me. From that page, it looks like David has only been working at Evolution Recruitment for a month, or less. So David, you&#39;re new to the position and need to build up some leads. Fair enough. But don&#39;t take me as a fool mate.</p>
