      <p>It has to be said, I am the type of person that gets very focussed on a particular subject. When in this focussed mode, I find it very difficult to look outside of my field of vision at other options as I&#39;m so focussed on achieving what is currently set out in front of me. Every now and then though, something will connect with me in the right way, at the right moment, that will allow me to open my eyes a little to a new idea or concept and it will change my thoughts and perception instantly.</p>

<p>This has been my history with many things including music, gadgets I want to buy, shows I like to watch, and programming languages.</p>

<p>The reason I bring this up is because up until a while ago Ruby was one of those things that I just didn&#39;t have an interest in looking at because I was too focussed on Java. I have been using Java for over 10 years and I am good at it. And I am focussed on continually getting better at it. That was until about 6 months ago when I was working in a team that used Ruby for testing their Java apps. It was at this point that the wonder of Ruby hit me from out of nowhere. I was temporarily distracted from Java and Ruby came in and blew me away. And now I can&#39;t stop thinking about it, to the extent that I don&#39;t want to waste any more time on Java. How the hell did this happen?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you how. </p>

<p>Over the space of a few weeks I was explained what Ruby is and how it works. I was shown the sexy and efficient syntax and how much more time efficient some of the constructs that are built into the language are than Java. I was shown how easy it is to get a basic RESTful &#39;Hello World&#39; app up and running, measured literally in seconds as opposed to minutes or hours in Java. I was shown the wonder of BDD with cucumber and how executable instructions written in plain english can make functional testing and bridging the gap between developers and product ownsers a pleasure. And, one of the most important things, I learnt and understood aspects about the under the covers of Ruby that I never knew, learnt or cared to learn about Java. And it all made sense. </p>

<p>All these things got me intrigued enough to wonder whether I should be looking harder into Ruby and whether Java really was the language I wanted to focus the majority of my time on. The feeling I was starting to get from those 6 months with Ruby was why am I using Java?  Ruby makes things so much easier, simpler and most importantly quicker. It is a pleasure to use Ruby. I was getting a feeling that I had not really ever experienced from Java. This made me want to learn more.</p>

<p>So, that is my quest at the moment. Ruby has stolen my focus for now. I am on a crusade to become great at it. I am not giving up on Java by any means, I am mearly expanding my toolkit. But I think, for now, I&#39;m aiming on moving my Java hammer to the side and hanging the shiny new Ruby one in the center of the tool shed. </p>

<p>Side Note: It&#39;s funny because over the years I have heard countless stories of developers working in a Java role who would always bang on about Ruby and bust it out to automate different small tasks. I never understood why. Now I do. And I think I&#39;m turning into one of them :)</p>
