Introducing my latest Ruby project I've been working on in parallel with CoffeeSnobs:

[Is the water safe to drink?][1]

ITWSTD is built in Ruby using Sinatra, Haml and DataMapper. I am using IndexTank for full text indexing/search and it is deployed on Heroku.

I've been working on this with a couple of friends from [www.laurenbugeja.com][2] who's initial idea this was, and who has been doing the UX design.

It's been a fun little project and hopefully it will help anyone who is travelling in a far away country where brushing your teeth with the local water could mean the difference between fun memories and 10 days on the toilet.
