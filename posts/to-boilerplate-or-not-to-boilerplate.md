title: To Boilerplate or Not To Boilerplate?

I just created a public repo on GitHub to store a basic boilerplate Ruby project so that I don't always need to recreate the basics from scratch. I'm in two minds about this. 

In one way I think it's handy because there is a bit of chuff that needs to happen at the start of every project and this is a good way to minimise having to recreate it every time. 

On the other hand, I think a project's structure is never complete and always changes. I believe you should always look for ways to improve and refactor your code to make it easier to understand and feel more 'right'. By constantly using the same boilerplate project this may stop one from thinking of better ways to start off the project. However, this is a very minimal boilerplate project and really is just used to get up and running.

I'll see how it goes and will continue to improve it. And if anyone would like to make any suggestions, or make the changes themselves and create a Pull Request, go ahead.
