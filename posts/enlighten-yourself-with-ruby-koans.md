A wise man once said "Java will enrage, Ruby will enlighten". I've been on the path of "enragement" for the past 10 years or so but a few months ago I found the start of the path to elightenment. And it is called [Ruby Koans][1].

Even though I found out about Ruby Koans months ago, I came across it again the other day on my mac and had another play around with it and it made me want to write a short blog post on it. It's a great way to learn Ruby.

Ruby Koans is basically an interactive Ruby tutorial that guides one from the darkness of Ruby ignorance through the path to Ruby enlightenment. It is basically a series of Ruby files each covering different aspects of the Ruby programming language such as arrays, blocks, exceptions, modules, symbols etc etc.  Each file is essentially a number of tests covering specific topics that are initialised to fail. As you run Ruby Koans, you will go through each test, fixing it to make it pass and in turn learning something new about the Ruby language.

It's a very simple concept but it is effective. If you are new to Ruby, or even if you're an expert, have a play with Ruby Koans and let me know what you think.
