  <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/oracle-and-activerecord-on-linux">Oracle and ActiveRecord on Linux</a> <span class="date">2012-04-04</span></h3>

  <p>So, I&#39;ve been playing with <a href="http://vagrantup.com/" title="Vagrant">Vagrant</a> over the last day or so in the hope that we can use it to speed up the time it takes to get new starters up and running and also to speed up our cucumber test suite for the windows users among our team.</p>

<p>I am hoping that we will be able to spin up a light weight Linux distro with Ruby installed, allowing team members to run their features from there. This means we will no longer need to muck around installing Ruby on Windows (which is a pain) and hopefully it runs faster than it does on Windows.</p>

<p>In setting up this Vagrant box I came across the same issue that I did when setting cucumber up for our project on my Mac. Oracle causes issues with ActiveRecord. So, I thought I&#39;d record, here, the way I fixed this once and for all so I don&#39;t need to go searching the net for it again.</p>

<p>So, starting out with a vanilla install of Ubuntu Lucid Lynx with only <code>rbenv</code> and <code>ruby</code> installed, I did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Download <code>instantclient-basic-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip</code> and <code>instantclient-sdk-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip</code> and copy them to the Vagrant project directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the following commands:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="bash">digital-alley:tmpdir aaron$ vagrant up
digital-alley:tmpdir aaron$ vagrant ssh

vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo apt-get install unzip
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo apt-get install rpm
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd /tmp
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cp /vagrant/instantclient-* .
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd /opt
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo mkdir oracle
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd oracle
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo unzip /tmp/instantclient-basic-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo unzip /tmp/instantclient-sdk-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd instantclient_11_2
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo ln -s libclntsh.so.11.1 libclntsh.so
vagrant@lucid32:~$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_2
vagrant@lucid32:~$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd /vagrant
vagrant@lucid32:~$ gem install ruby-oci8
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo apt-get install libaio-dev
</code></pre>

  <p>Hey Crunch Team, just had a bit of a squiz over <a href="http://support.crunch.co.uk/attachments/token/t6tkagiuvv95esz/?name=Crunch_API.pdf" title="Crunch API Documentation">your new your API</a> and wanted to put forward some feedback, suggestions and a few opinions.</p>

<p>Now, everything following this is based on my understanding of the REST spec, my beliefs of how a RESTful API should be designed and any opinions I have along the way.</p>

<p>I basically skipped over the OAuth stuff and on to the endpoints which is what interests me the most, so let&#39;s get started.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Naming</h3>

<p>The way I look at a RESTful resource URI is similar to how I look at a folder structure on a file system. On my filesystem, in my <code>suppliers</code> folder, I might have a list of suppliers listed by <code>id</code>. Inside each <code>id</code> folder I have any folders and data that correspond to the specific supplier.</p>

<p>So, if we take a look at your services to get a list of suppliers and expenses...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/suppliers<br>
/rest/api/expenses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...things look pretty good. To get a list of my suppliers, I look in my <code>suppliers</code> folder. Likewise, for my expenses, I look in my <code>expenses</code> folder. So far so good.</p>

<p>However, now let&#39;s take a look at the services behind GETting a specific supplier or expense:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/supplier/{id}<br>
/rest/api/expense/{id}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where I think things start to fall down a little. What you have done here is tell me that there is a folder, or resource if you will, called supplier, at the same level as the suppliers/expenses folder. And you are also telling me that I will find the supplier/expense for a specific ID in this folder.</p>

<p>What I would actually expect to find is a specific supplier underneath the <code>suppliers</code> folder on my filesystem...wouldn&#39;t I? Maybe something like this is more appropriate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rest/api/supplier<strong>s</strong>/{id}</p>
</blockquote>

  <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/include-vs-extend-whats-the-difference">Include vs Extend. What's the difference?</a> <span class="date">2011-08-26</span></h3>

  <p>So, I was wondering the other day what the hell the difference between <code>include</code> and <code>extend</code> in Ruby are and which one you&#39;d want to use under what circumstances. After a bit of digging around on the net and playing with some code, it turns out that the answer is really quite simple. I&#39;m sure for all Ruby experts this is a no brainer but since I am early on in my <a href="enlighten-yourself-with-ruby-koans" title="Ruby Koans">path to enlightenment</a>, I wanted to document it so I can cement the concept in my mind. </p>

<p>Firstly, simply put, both include and extend are Ruby&#39;s keywords to allow a class to inherit methods from a module. The difference between the two is thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>include</code> allows you to inherit methods as Instance Methods.<br>
<code>extend</code> allows you to inherit methods as Class Methods. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the way I&#39;ve been remembering this is that <strong>IN</strong>clude adds <strong>IN</strong>stance methods.</p>

<p>This is not unlike Java&#39;s <code>extends</code> keyword, however, the idea of include/extend in Ruby I find is slightly different. In Java, to extend something means that the extending class IS-A subclass of the super class. In Ruby this doesn&#39;t seem to be the way to think about it. It would seem that to include/extend a module in Ruby simply means that the including class wants to take on the methods of the Module. It can be totally unrelated in terms of an object hierarchy.</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#39;s have a little look at some code to explain the difference between include and extend.</p>

<pre><code>module Tweet
  def save
    puts &#39;Tweet saved&#39;
  end
end

class Foo
  include Tweet # Add methods from Tweet as Instances Methods
end

class Bar
  extend Tweet # Add methods from Tweet as Class Methods
end
Foo.save # =&gt; undefined method `save&#39; for Foo:Class (NoMethodError)
Foo.new.save # =&gt; Tweet saved
Bar.save # =&gt; Tweet saved
Bar.new.save # =&gt; undefined method `save&#39; for #&lt;Bar:0x007f813104e0e8&gt; (NoMethodError)
</code></pre>

  <p>Introducing my latest Ruby project I&#39;ve been working on in parallel with CoffeeSnobs:</p>

<p><a href="http://safewater.heroku.com/" title="Is the water safe to drink?">Is the water safe to drink?</a></p>

<p>ITWSTD is built in Ruby using Sinatra, Haml and DataMapper. I am using IndexTank for full text indexing/search and it is deployed on Heroku.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on this with a couple of friends from <a href="www.laurenbugeja.com" title="www.laurenbugeja.com">www.laurenbugeja.com</a> who&#39;s initial idea this was, and who has been doing the UX design.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a fun little project and hopefully it will help anyone who is travelling in a far away country where brushing your teeth with the local water could mean the difference between fun memories and 10 days on the toilet.</p>

  <p>So I got a call from a recruiter this morning. The call started off as normal. &quot;<strong>Hi, this is David Dowdall blah blah blah. I have some roles in the Finance industry I think you&#39;ll be interested in blah blah blah</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>So, I stopped David there to tell him that I&#39;m not interested in the finance industry and this is where it started to turn a bit strange. And by that I mean I started to get a feeling that David was taking me for a fool.</p>

<p>David started banging on about something along the lines of needing to confirm some details with me for secuirty reasons. Security reasons?  Do you have a top secret role for me in the NSA?  He needed to confirm my name and last 2 places of work, and really needed my line manager&#39;s name and contact details as references so that my CV would look credible and the client would look favourably on my application.</p>

<p>Now HOLD ON THERE David. What client?  What application?  You haven&#39;t even mentioned any role to me and I sure has hell haven&#39;t asked you to put me forward for it.</p>

<p>He went on to ask for details on the interviews that I have coming up. And of course that was for my benefit as well so that he wouldn&#39;t put me forward for any of the same companies. Again, HOLD YOUR HORSES David. There won&#39;t be any problem of that happening either because you won&#39;t be putting me forward for anything without me giving you permission first.</p>

<p>So, after our conversation where David was obviously digging for leads and obviously had no roles for me, I received an email from him. It went as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Aaron,
<br/><br/>
Many thanks for your time. 
Please click here to enter your references from your most recent employers. It would be good, where possible, to show them to
companies that are interested in you. This will really help you get the position you want as it creates credibility with your
application.
<br/><br/>
Ideally the references you give will be/have been, your direct line manager at the company. Include your current/most recent
employer; however they will not be approached without your prior written permission.
<br/><br/>
In addition, in reply to this email, it is important that you keep me updated with any details of where you have sent your CV
and where you have been/are going for interview. This includes company applied for, location, role applied for and manager&#39;s
name if possible.
<br/><br/>
This is so that any applications I make on your behalf will not damage any pre-existing applications, this will save wasting
your time and help me work faster.
<br/><br/>
Finally, please keep me up to date with your employment situation i.e. interviews or job offers as it would be unfair to put
you forward to anyone should your situation change.
<br/><br/>
Speak to you soon,
<br/><br/>
David Dowdall<br>
