  <p>What does your git workflow look like?</p>

<p>Since I started using git about 2 years ago I&#39;ve constantly been trying to 
improve my git workflow. As I began to form a clearer picture in my mnind of 
how git stores commits, how branches work, how merging works etc, I slowly refined 
how I go about committing to my projects. While I&#39;m far from  a git 
guru, I&#39;m pretty happy with my current workflow so thought I&#39;d share it.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_0">A clean slate</h2>

<p>Firstly, make sure <code>master</code> is up to date.</p>

<pre><code>df21be6 Aaron Chambers     o [master] [origin/master] Test commit
37cedd7 Aaron Chambers     I first commit
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_1">Branch out and commit away</h2>

<p>Now, create a local branch and commit until your heart&#39;s content.</p>

<pre><code>~/code/my-project (master)$ git checkout -b bug-fix
Switched to a new branch &#39;bug-fix&#39;

~/code/my-project (bug-fix)$ echo &quot;Fixing bugs&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md
~/code/my-project (bug-fix)$ git commit -am &quot;Swatting bugs&quot;
[bug-fix 2e2b000] Swatting bugs
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

~/code/my-project (bug-fix)$ echo &quot;Fixing more bugs&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md
~/code/my-project (bug-fix)$ git commit -am &quot;Getting out the bug spray&quot;
[bug-fix 9917b19] Getting out the bug spray
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

~/code/my-project (bug-fix)$ echo &quot;Fixing yet more bugs&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md
~/code/my-project (bug-fix)$ git commit -am &quot;And now for the bug zapper&quot;
[bug-fix 1fdd4c2] And now for the bug zapper
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</code></pre>

<p>If we have a quick look at the commit tree we can see things look pretty good. 
My branch commits come directly after the last commit on <code>master</code> (<code>df21be6</code>).</p>

<pre><code>928041a Aaron Chambers     o [bug-fix] And now for the bug zapper
ed49f8b Aaron Chambers     o Getting out the bug spray
21dffcd Aaron Chambers     o Swatting bugs
df21be6 Aaron Chambers     o [master] [origin/master] Test commit
37cedd7 Aaron Chambers     I first commit
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_2">Pull me oh master</h2>

<p>Now we need to go back to <code>master</code> and see if anyone else has committed to it 
since we last pulled.</p>

<pre><code>~/code/my-project (bug-fix)$ git checkout master
Switched to branch &#39;master&#39;

~/code/my-project (master)$ git pull

  <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/oracle-and-activerecord-on-linux">Oracle and ActiveRecord on Linux</a> <span class="date">2012-04-04</span></h3>

  <p>So, I&#39;ve been playing with <a href="http://vagrantup.com/" title="Vagrant">Vagrant</a> over the last day or so in the hope that we can use it to speed up the time it takes to get new starters up and running and also to speed up our cucumber test suite for the windows users among our team.</p>

<p>I am hoping that we will be able to spin up a light weight Linux distro with Ruby installed, allowing team members to run their features from there. This means we will no longer need to muck around installing Ruby on Windows (which is a pain) and hopefully it runs faster than it does on Windows.</p>

<p>In setting up this Vagrant box I came across the same issue that I did when setting cucumber up for our project on my Mac. Oracle causes issues with ActiveRecord. So, I thought I&#39;d record, here, the way I fixed this once and for all so I don&#39;t need to go searching the net for it again.</p>

<p>So, starting out with a vanilla install of Ubuntu Lucid Lynx with only <code>rbenv</code> and <code>ruby</code> installed, I did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Download <code>instantclient-basic-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip</code> and <code>instantclient-sdk-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip</code> and copy them to the Vagrant project directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the following commands:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="bash">digital-alley:tmpdir aaron$ vagrant up
digital-alley:tmpdir aaron$ vagrant ssh

vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo apt-get install unzip
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo apt-get install rpm
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd /tmp
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cp /vagrant/instantclient-* .
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd /opt
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo mkdir oracle
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd oracle
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo unzip /tmp/instantclient-basic-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo unzip /tmp/instantclient-sdk-linux-11.2.0.3.0.zip
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd instantclient_11_2
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo ln -s libclntsh.so.11.1 libclntsh.so
vagrant@lucid32:~$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_2
vagrant@lucid32:~$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
vagrant@lucid32:~$ cd /vagrant
vagrant@lucid32:~$ gem install ruby-oci8
vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo apt-get install libaio-dev
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>To test that this all worked, run the following:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="bash">vagrant@lucid32:~$ irb

irb(main):001:0&gt; require &#39;rubygems&#39;
irb(main):001:0&gt; require &#39;oci8&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>And there you have it!</p>

<p>PS, A couple of props to the sites that helped me achieve this solution:</p>

  <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/crunch-api-my-feedback-suggestions-and-opinions">Crunch API - My feedback, suggestions and opinions</a> <span class="date">2012-01-11</span></h3>

  <p>Hey Crunch Team, just had a bit of a squiz over <a href="http://support.crunch.co.uk/attachments/token/t6tkagiuvv95esz/?name=Crunch_API.pdf" title="Crunch API Documentation">your new your API</a> and wanted to put forward some feedback, suggestions and a few opinions.</p>

<p>Now, everything following this is based on my understanding of the REST spec, my beliefs of how a RESTful API should be designed and any opinions I have along the way.</p>

<p>I basically skipped over the OAuth stuff and on to the endpoints which is what interests me the most, so let&#39;s get started.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Naming</h3>

<p>The way I look at a RESTful resource URI is similar to how I look at a folder structure on a file system. On my filesystem, in my <code>suppliers</code> folder, I might have a list of suppliers listed by <code>id</code>. Inside each <code>id</code> folder I have any folders and data that correspond to the specific supplier.</p>

<p>So, if we take a look at your services to get a list of suppliers and expenses...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/suppliers<br>
/rest/api/expenses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...things look pretty good. To get a list of my suppliers, I look in my <code>suppliers</code> folder. Likewise, for my expenses, I look in my <code>expenses</code> folder. So far so good.</p>

<p>However, now let&#39;s take a look at the services behind GETting a specific supplier or expense:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/supplier/{id}<br>
/rest/api/expense/{id}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where I think things start to fall down a little. What you have done here is tell me that there is a folder, or resource if you will, called supplier, at the same level as the suppliers/expenses folder. And you are also telling me that I will find the supplier/expense for a specific ID in this folder.</p>

<p>What I would actually expect to find is a specific supplier underneath the <code>suppliers</code> folder on my filesystem...wouldn&#39;t I? Maybe something like this is more appropriate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rest/api/supplier<strong>s</strong>/{id}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the <code>s</code>? It is a very small point, and it&#39;s all semantics, however, I still think it&#39;s important. The supplier I want is in the list of suppliers that lives inside the <code>suppliers</code> folder.</p>

<p>Next up, lets have a quick look at:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expense/expenseTypes<br>
/rest/api/expense/paymentMethods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, if we follow the folder theme, it doesn&#39;t, in my mind, make sense that I would look in the expense folder to find a list of possible expenseTypes or paymentMethods. To me, I would have my <code>expenses</code> folder which contained my list of expenses and then when I wanted to find the possible list of expenseTypes, I&#39;d probably find that in it&#39;s own folder at the top level like so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/expense_types</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, I&#39;d probably do the same thing with payment methods:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/payment_methods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason behind this is they are, in a way, top level resources. They don&#39;t live as subordinates of an expense, or anything else really.</p>

<p>Now on to accounts. Let&#39;s have a look at your current URI&#39;s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/accounts/allAccounts<br>
/rest/api/accounts/bankAccounts<br>
/rest/api/accounts/creditCards</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking back to the folder analogy, on my filesystem, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d arrange my accounts in <code>allAccounts</code>, <code>bankAccounts</code> and <code>creditCards</code> folders underneath an <code>accounts</code> folder. That doesn&#39;t really make sense to me. In my mind it would make more sense to have all my accounts sitting inside the <code>accounts</code> folder and each account would have a type. So when I want to get a list of all my accounts I&#39;d probably go to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/accounts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I wanted only accounts that were bank accounts, I&#39;d probably look for accounts, in the <code>accounts</code> folder that have a type <code>bankAccount</code> like so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/rest/api/accounts?type=bank_account</p>
</blockquote>

  <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/include-vs-extend-whats-the-difference">Include vs Extend. What's the difference?</a> <span class="date">2011-08-26</span></h3>

  <p>So, I was wondering the other day what the hell the difference between <code>include</code> and <code>extend</code> in Ruby are and which one you&#39;d want to use under what circumstances. After a bit of digging around on the net and playing with some code, it turns out that the answer is really quite simple. I&#39;m sure for all Ruby experts this is a no brainer but since I am early on in my <a href="enlighten-yourself-with-ruby-koans" title="Ruby Koans">path to enlightenment</a>, I wanted to document it so I can cement the concept in my mind. </p>

<p>Firstly, simply put, both include and extend are Ruby&#39;s keywords to allow a class to inherit methods from a module. The difference between the two is thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>include</code> allows you to inherit methods as Instance Methods.<br>
<code>extend</code> allows you to inherit methods as Class Methods. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the way I&#39;ve been remembering this is that <strong>IN</strong>clude adds <strong>IN</strong>stance methods.</p>

<p>This is not unlike Java&#39;s <code>extends</code> keyword, however, the idea of include/extend in Ruby I find is slightly different. In Java, to extend something means that the extending class IS-A subclass of the super class. In Ruby this doesn&#39;t seem to be the way to think about it. It would seem that to include/extend a module in Ruby simply means that the including class wants to take on the methods of the Module. It can be totally unrelated in terms of an object hierarchy.</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#39;s have a little look at some code to explain the difference between include and extend.</p>

<pre><code>module Tweet
  def save
    puts &#39;Tweet saved&#39;
  end
end

class Foo
  include Tweet # Add methods from Tweet as Instances Methods
end

class Bar
  extend Tweet # Add methods from Tweet as Class Methods
end
Foo.save # =&gt; undefined method `save&#39; for Foo:Class (NoMethodError)
Foo.new.save # =&gt; Tweet saved
Bar.save # =&gt; Tweet saved
Bar.new.save # =&gt; undefined method `save&#39; for #&lt;Bar:0x007f813104e0e8&gt; (NoMethodError)
</code></pre>

<p>A small shout out to <a href="http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/05/15/include-vs-extend-in-ruby/" title="Rails Tips">John Nunemaker</a> who&#39;s post I found that explain&#39;s this concept nicely.</p>

  <p>Introducing my latest Ruby project I&#39;ve been working on in parallel with CoffeeSnobs:</p>

<p><a href="http://safewater.heroku.com/" title="Is the water safe to drink?">Is the water safe to drink?</a></p>

<p>ITWSTD is built in Ruby using Sinatra, Haml and DataMapper. I am using IndexTank for full text indexing/search and it is deployed on Heroku.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on this with a couple of friends from <a href="www.laurenbugeja.com" title="www.laurenbugeja.com">www.laurenbugeja.com</a> who&#39;s initial idea this was, and who has been doing the UX design.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a fun little project and hopefully it will help anyone who is travelling in a far away country where brushing your teeth with the local water could mean the difference between fun memories and 10 days on the toilet.</p>
