My name is <a href="https://plus.google.com/110082834525527581229?rel=author">Aaron Chambers</a>.  I'm an Aussie, a fiance and a lover of all things software.  I'm a software craftsman living in London.  This is my software development (among other things) blog.

I am currently employed by [{{ data.author.employer }}][1].  I maintain the [crunch-api][2] gem and I wrote the [Is The Water Safe To Drink?][3] site. My current obsessions are {{ data.author.obsessions }}.

I love listening to the [Ruby Rogues][4] and [This American Life][5] podcasts.

If you are on Twitter, you can follow me at [@grandazz][6].

The title of this blog comes from the fact that I am generally a super happy guy. But when I get hungry....well....you better watch out ;)
